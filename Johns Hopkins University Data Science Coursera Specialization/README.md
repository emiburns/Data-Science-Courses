### About this Specialization

This Specialization covers the concepts and tools you’ll need throughout
the entire data science pipeline, from asking the right kinds of
questions to making inferences and publishing results. In the final
Capstone Project, you’ll apply the skills learned by building a data
product using real-world data. At completion, students will have a
portfolio demonstrating their mastery of the material.
